# my-portfolio

## The main focus of this project is to generate my portfolio by creating my own html and css code.

The format of my portfolio was based on an example provided in this weeks homework repo. My portfolio was styled different with a pink color scheme. I first worked on the html to make sure that I achieve the semantic elements. I started with the header and work my way down to the contact section. I struggled a bit with deciding which tag to place in each section so I decided to googe each tag that I thought would work. I am satisfied with each tag choice. 

Next, I worked on the css stylesheet. I always get confused on the stylesheet because of all the properties input. I decided to add each element on css as I input each tag in html. My method worked. I got confused at times and I found that writing down the code on paper put this in a different perspective. Google helped alot wiht the stylesheet.

I am satisfied with the results. The following image shows the completed web application:
